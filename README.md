# MSDS-451-Week7-Programming-Assignment3

This repository contains the full implementation and analysis of a **momentum-based trading strategy** developed for the **MSDS 451: Programming for Data Science** course at Northwestern University.  
The strategy evaluates whether simple trading signals based on daily momentum can outperform passive market benchmarks like SPY and QQQ over the period **2019â€“2024**.
